        <h2>Objective Statement</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dynamic and adaptable professional with a strong foundation in
            performing arts, beauty, and entrepreneurship. My journey has led me from
            the entertainment industry to beauty therapy, and ultimately to business
            ownership, where I successfully launched an occupational therapy product
            line and a guesthouse in Wonderboom South, Pretoria, South Africa. With a
            passion for continuous learning, I am currently expanding my skill set in
            web development, embracing technology to enhance both creative and
            business pursuits. I thrive in roles that require innovation,
            problem-solving, and strategic planning, and I am eager to apply my
            diverse expertise in a forward-thinking environment.
